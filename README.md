This weather dashboard uses server-side APIs to get up-to-date weather information for a specific city. In this case, we use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. In the background, we make requests with specific parameters to a URL to retrieve the data from another application's API. This weather dashboard runs in the browser and it dynamically updates HTML and CSS with Javascript. The information retrived for a specific city is saved in localStorage to store the data and make it persistent. This weather dashboard is perfect for a person traveling domestically or internationally that want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. This weather dashboard allows a traveler to plan a trip accordingly.
